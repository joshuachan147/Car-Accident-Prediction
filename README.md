# Car-Accident-Prediction

**Project Goals**: 
 1. Apply machine learning regression techniques to a very large dataset in order to see how methods must change when working with big data
 2. Create heatmaps of car accident severity across the US and predict weather/road condition factors that cause accidents

**Dataset**:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents 
 - 2.8 million datapoints about car accidents from 2016-2021 in the continental US
 - Predictors: mix of quantitative (weather related), boolean (road condition), and location data
 - Response: Numeric variable 1-4 measuring car accident severity (severity measured in road disruption time)

**Model Choices**
 - Linear Model
 - Feature Selection Models (Lasso/Ridge/Elastic Net)
 - Boruta
 - GAM with tensors
 - Regression Tree
 - Gradient Boosting Algorithm
